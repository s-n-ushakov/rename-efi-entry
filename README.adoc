A Bash script to rename EFI boot entries

## Background

### EFI{nbsp}/ UEFI, boot configurations

EFI{nbsp}/ https://uefi.org/[UEFI] is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and
platform firmware. It is intended by hardware manufacturers to replace the legacy BIOS firmware interface.

In particular this specification allows to define OS boot configurations to be loaded{nbsp}/ executed upon system power
on. These boot configurations specify disk partitions to boot from and are typically identified by their text labels
that are listed in the "Startup"{nbsp}/ "Boot" EFI setup section. These boot configurations may be optionally selectable
upon system startup.

### The problem

Operating system installation routines tend to have these boot configuration labels hard-coded and to create them in EFI
PROM automatically. So in case a computer has, say, several Ubuntu instances installed, it is also likely to have
several identical "ubuntu" boot configuration labels in its EFI menus, causing a kind of confusion.

One might further want to rename boot configurations, so to make them distinguishable, but unfortunately the standard
https://github.com/rhboot/efibootmgr[`efibootmgr`] utility has no option for that. It is only possible to delete a boot
configuration entry and re-create it with a new label. Meanwhile, the data that is necessary for re-creating a boot
configuration entry is not trivial and requires certain inquiries into EFI configuration and disk partition attributes.

## The script

The `rename-efi-entry` script is designed to facilitate renaming EFI boot configuration entries using `efibootmgr`
utility. It automates querying current EFI configuration and bootable partition data, and also shaping command line
arguments for `efibootmgr`.

### Usage

 sudo ./rename-efi-entry.bash existing_efi_label new_efi_label [bootnum]

[%autowidth,cols=2*.<]
.Command line arguments
|===
|`existing_efi_label`
|existing EFI entry label to be renamed

|`new_efi_label`
|the new label value to be assigned

|`bootnum`
|optional: the `bootnum` value of the EFI entry to be renamed, required in case of repeating label values to avoid
ambiguity 
|===

E.g.:

 sudo ./rename-efi-entry ubuntu 'ubuntu 18.04'

or in case of multiple boot entries labeled as 'ubuntu':

 sudo ./rename-efi-entry ubuntu 'ubuntu 18.04' 0001

In case of doubt `bootnum` values may be clarified using `efibootmgr --verbose` command:

....
$ efibootmgr --verbose
BootCurrent: 0001
Timeout: 0 seconds
BootOrder: 0002,0001,0017,001B,0000,0016,0019,001A,0018
Boot0000  Windows Boot Manager	HD(1,MBR,0x5092863d,0x3cde8c,0x1340)/File(\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi)WINDOWS...
Boot0001* ubuntu            	HD(1,GPT,2ffcc127-f6ce-40f0-9932-d1dfd14e9462,0x800,0x100000)/File(\EFI\ubuntu\shimx64.efi)
Boot0002* ubuntu            	HD(1,GPT,cba13b09-d754-4d31-9719-369fa60928d1,0x800,0x100000)/File(\EFI\ubuntu\shimx64.efi)
Boot0010  ...
....

Required `bootnum` values (e.g. `0001` from `Boot0001`) may be further identified by checking corresponding `uuid`
values (e.g. `2ffcc127-f6ce-40f0-9932-d1dfd14e9462`) against values provided by `sfdisk -d` command, e.g.:

....
$ sudo sfdisk -d /dev/sda
label: gpt
label-id: 0560DAA2-3010-47A2-B083-047C813F0A04
device: /dev/sda
unit: sectors
first-lba: 34
last-lba: 1953525134

/dev/sda1 : start=        2048, size=     1048576, type=C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B, uuid=2FFCC127-F6CE-40F0-9932-D1DFD14E9462, name="EFI System Partition"
/dev/sda2 : start=     1050624, size=   102400000, type=0FC63DAF-8483-4772-8E79-3D69D8477DE4, uuid=A06790C2-3818-4F57-84EF-4D1B9FFB417E, name="SSD system"
/dev/sda3 : start=   103450624, size=  1850073088, type=0FC63DAF-8483-4772-8E79-3D69D8477DE4, uuid=67A374C2-081E-477E-945C-78BE129A2044, name="SSD data"
....

### Implementation details

What the script does under the hood, is:

- obtain a list of disk devices using `lsblk`;
- obtain a list of disk partitions and their `uuid` values for every disk device using `sfdisk`;
- obtain a list of EFI boot entries using `efibootmgr`;
- filter EFI boot entries against `existing_efi_label` value, supplied by the user as command line argument;
- make sure that this boot entry identification is unique, using `bootnum` if necessary;
- extract `uuid` value from the EFI boot entry to be renamed, and use it to identify the relevant disk partition and its
device name;
- verify matching of partition numbers between EFI boot entry and partition device name;
- shape the commands for `efibootmgr` to delete the existing EFI boot entry and to create a new one with required label;
- ask final user consent;
- apply the `efibootmgr` commands. 

### Limitations

This script can only rename EFI boot entries that are related to Linux. It will most probably ignore the other ones.

### Important usage notes

Feel free to use, but do it on your risk :)

It may be wise to review the `efibootmgr` commands before final execution...
